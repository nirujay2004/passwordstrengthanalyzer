# passwordstrengthanalyzer

This Python script provides a comprehensive password strength analysis tool that calculates password entropy, rates password strength, and estimates crack time. It offers detailed insights into password security and provides actionable recommendations for improving password quality.

To check passwords you need to alter the python script file. For more advanced usage, consider rewriting the script to use argparse. This will allow you to pass the password and guesses per second as command-line arguments, making the script more suitable for terminal use and integration with other tools.
